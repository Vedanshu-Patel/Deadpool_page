            <h2>It's the Leader of the X Force, Deadpool</h2>
            <p>
                X-Force is a team of superheroes  most commonly in association with the X-Men. The team first appeared in New Mutants #100 (April 1991) and soon afterwards was featured in its own series called X-Force. The group was originally a revamped version of the 1980s team, the New Mutants.
            X-Force's first leader was the mutant Cable. An offshoot of the X-Men, X-Force takes a more militant and aggressive approach towards its enemies compared to the X-Men. An alternate incarnation of X-Force appears in the 2018 , Deadpool  as part of the X-Men  series. A planned X-Force  adaption by 20th Century Fox was in production, but it was stopped after Disney killed 20th Century Fox.
